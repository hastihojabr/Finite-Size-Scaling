# Finite-Size-Scaling
We found critical exponents for 2d Ising model and critical temperture for special cases of N-vector model.

## Critical Exponents 

The finite size scaling method is a way of extracting values for critical exponents by observing how measured quantities vary as the size L of the system studied changes.

#### Nu
Nu is Correlation length’s exponent. The result from fit is ν = 0.91. The analytical value of ν is 1. So the accuracy is about 91.2 percent.

#### Beta
The result from fit is β = 0.1. The analytical value of β is 8 . So the accuracy is about 83 percent.

#### alpha
The scaling relation for specific heat gives us alpha. The result from fit is α = 0.13. The analytical value of α is zero. So the accuracy is about 87 percent.

#### Gamma 
The scaling relation for susceptibility heat gives us alpha. The result from fit is γ = 1.7. The analytical value of γ is 4 . So the accuracy is about 96.34 percent.

## Critical Temperture 

Another frequently used method to determine the critical point is to use the intersection points of the Binder cumulants. U_L varies weakly with temperature and linear dimension d near the crucial temperature and it stays close to a universal point.
